# ABC Company Employee Analysis



## Overview:


This project aims to analyze the employee dataset from ABC Company to gain insights into employee demographics, team distribution, salary expenditure, and potential correlations between variables. The analysis involves preprocessing the dataset, performing various analysis tasks, creating graphical representations, and deriving key insights from the data.





## Dataset:
The dataset provided by ABC Company consists of employee records with attributes such as age, position, salary, and team affiliation. The dataset is structured with 458 rows and 9 columns.

## Preprocessing:


*) Corrected the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.

*) Handled missing values using dropna, isnull, fillna methods to ensure data integrity.

## Analysis Tasks:

*)Determined the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.

*)Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.

*)Identified the predominant age group among employees.

*)Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.

*)Investigated the correlation between age and salary.

## Graphical Representations:

*)Created bar plots and pie charts to visualize the distribution of employees across teams and positions.

*)Used scatter plots and line charts to represent salary expenditure by team and age versus salary.

*)Utilized seaborn for enhanced visualization with regression lines and joint plots.

## Insights Gained:

*)Found a weak positive correlation between age and salary.

*)Identified the Los Angeles Clippers as the team with the highest salary expenditure.

*)Discovered that the predominant age group among employees is 20-29.

*)Analyzed the distribution of employees across teams and positions to understand organizational dynamics.

## Additional Information:

Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn were utilized for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

The project's code is provided in Jupyter Notebook format for reproducibility and further exploration.
